# FontUpdate

Patches LC's Font and adds the Expanded Unicode Latin Characters.

As of right now the mod has two main configurations:
### FontMode
- **Normal**: Uses the updated font.
- **NoDollar**: Uses a version of the updated font without the $ symbol (like vanilla) in case you run into unexpected formatting issues with other mods or "ghosting" behind characters.

For now the Default configuration is set to **NoDollar**, since is the most stable. 

### Chat Character Limit

Vanilla chat has a 50 character cap in it's chat, this mod "hardcap" it to 50 like in vanilla so it is not noticeable ingame. If you're using any other chat mod that expands the character limit of the chat, you can now change that cap as you please (set it to -1 to have it unlimited).

### Known Issues:
- "The character used for underline is not available in font asset" warning, for now it doesn't seem to be a noticeable problem in-game, but I'll keep investigating. It seems like the "NoDollar" config fixes it.
- Some mods that change the formatting of the console might break with this mod's "Normal" setting (because of the $ symbol restoration), if you're experiencing this please activate the "NoDollar" setting and/or contact me and the original modder.

If you are a modder or tester and want to help me a little feel free to jump to the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1351759076782116917), any help and feedback is very welcome!
