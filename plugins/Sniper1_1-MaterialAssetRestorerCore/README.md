Moon and interior devs are likely familiar with how poorly the certain assets rip when trying to design their levels. I made this tool to attempt to restore some at runtime. It can access materials both from within the vanilla prefabs and scenes. ([My thread in the LC Modding Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1245084720614604873))

This mod works by searching through a moon after it is loaded to replace the broken ones from modded moons/interiors with the corresponding one from vanilla. API specs and example useage below.

NOTE: IN ORDER TO ACCESS VANILLA MATERIALS FROM SCENES, THEY ARE BRIEFLY LOADED DURING `StartOfRound`. FROM MY TESTING THIS DID NOT CAUSE MAJOR PERMANENT ISSUES.

## API Docs For Devs

Create a json file (or multiple) with the format and in the direcotry shown below. Each json contains a list of `MaterialSets`. A `MaterialSet` is made up of a `BaseMaterial`, which is the name of the material in the vanilla game, and a `ReplaceMaterial`, which is the name of the material in your mod. Often these will likely be the same name, but they don't have to be. You must also specify either a `PrefabName` or a `SceneName` so that this tool knows where to look to find the `BaseMaterial`. 
```
{
    "MaterialSets": [
        {
            "BaseMaterial" : "gamematerial",
            "ReplaceMaterial" : "yourmaterial",
            "PrefabName" : "gameprefab"
        },
        {
            "BaseMaterial" : "gamematerial",
            "ReplaceMaterial" : "yourmaterial",
            "SceneName" : "gamescene"
        }
    ]
}
```

Project Heirarchy (NOTE: YOU MUST PLACE THE JSON FILE IN THE `plugins/MaterialReplacements/` FOLDER FOR THIS TO WORK):
