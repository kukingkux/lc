[![GitHub Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/digger1213/CruiserImproved/build.yml?branch=main&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/digger1213/CruiserImproved/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A clientside mod to improve the behaviour of Lethal Company's 'Company Cruiser' and fix some issues with its usage such as low visibility, high damage received from small impacts, and fix bugs.

### Features
All features can be configured or disabled in the generated .cfg file in BepInEx/config.
Clients will copy the host's settings if both sides have the mod installed.
- Ability to lean to look back around the side of the truck and through the small window by turning the camera around.
- Increased seat height for better visibility over the Cruiser's hood.
- Slight invulnerability for the Cruiser after taking damage to reduce the damage taken by rolling or multi-impacts at low speed.
- Short invulnerability for the Cruiser when critically damaged (engine on fire) allowing players to react and escape before the Cruiser explodes.
- Prevent knockback from Old Bird missiles knocking players out of the seat.
- Ability to push destroyed Cruisers.
- Prevent the Cruiser from sliding sideways down slopes (ie, when dropped off the magnet on Artifice).
- Prevent the Cruiser damage sound being detected by dogs if the engine is off, preventing them from repeatedly attacking Cruisers due to the sound they cause.
- Option to disable the Cruiser's radio interference static. Disabled by default.
- Ability to open the Cruiser's doors while holding a 2-handed item.
- Ability remove the key from the ignition while not seated.
- Added a scan node to the Cruiser to help locate it from far away. Can be configured to show turbos and health.
- Cruiser exhaust is tinted blue when it has stored turbo charges.
- Ability to toggle the Cruiser's cabin light by interacting with it.
- Ability to scan while seated in the Cruiser (thanks to [Buttery Stancakes](https://github.com/ButteryStancakes))
- \[Host\] Prevent anyone in the lobby other than the driver pressing the eject button on Cruisers. Disabled by default.
- \[Host\] Entities pathfind around stationary Cruisers with no one seated, instead of walking straight through and causing damage.
- \[Host\] Equipment and weapons moved into the ship from the Cruiser on save reload is sorted into a separate pile from the rest of the scrap.
- \[Host\] Magnet position, turbo boosts, and ignition state are saved and restored when loading a save, preventing lost turbos and removing the need to restart the ignition.

- \[Host&Client\] Fixed driven wheel torques not being synced.
