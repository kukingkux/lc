# ScienceBird Tweaks

Just some ~~small~~ changes my friends and I wanted that I couldn't find elsewhere (though some have since popped up as separate mods by others, I'm grouping the ones I want here for convenience and simplicity).

I recommend all players have this mod installed (and ideally the same/very similar config), but if you want to try using it client-side, **use the Client-side Mode config option**.

In the list below, I'll mention which tweaks (to my knowledge) should work client-side. My current testing setup isn't great for testing de-synced modpacks, so if any of this is wrong or if anything breaks client-side, please let me know.

---

*The default values of these tweaks are **intended to not interfere with gameplay in an undesired way**.*

*This should minimize upfront annoyance, but I recommend you consider which ones you want to enable.*

## SHIP TWEAKS

### Fixed Ship Objects

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Do you relate to being unable to press the teleport button while launching or landing the ship? Does it seem like its hitbox drifts away from where the button looks like it is? Have you ever stood on a piece of ship furniture (like the welcome mat) and jittered all over the place? Well, your struggles end now.

All this tweak does is ensure all ship furniture/unlockables will be parented to the main ship object, and thus all of their colliders will stay in sync with the ship.

- **Only Fix Vanilla Objects**: This is a setting to avoid any unwanted errors with attempting (or failing) to fix modded furniture items.

>*Default: ON*

*(If you do want to fix modded items, a configurable blacklist or whitelist is provided to only include certain modded items or exclude certain modded items from this fix)*

- **Alternate Fix Logic (EXPERIMENTAL)**: If you end up having any unexpected issues with furniture while using this tweak, you can try this. It's not super thoroughly tested, but it should simplify the code a bit to reduce possible points of failure or incompatibilities with other mods.

>*Default: OFF*

</details>

### Fixed Suit Rack

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Same as Fixed Ship Objects, but for suits: properly parents them so they are selectable easily on takeoff and landing without jitter.

![FixedSuits](https://imgur.com/D0Y5lFF.png)

</details>

### Consistent Catwalk Collision

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

If you've ever desperately clambered onto the edge of the ship's railing only to slide right off since you didn't catch the right part of the collision, this change is for you!

![RailingCollisionDemonstration](https://imgur.com/d9K9jAR.png)

This just slightly extends the floor collision of the ship catwalk so you can consistently land on it from the other side of the railing, allowing you to then gracefully vault over it at your leisure.

</details>

### Tiny Teleporter Collision

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Shrinks the placement hitbox of both teleporters so they can be more easily placed close to walls or in small spaces (and require less hassle with finnicky rotation).

The exact size of the hitbox is also adjustable in one of the config sections.

Note that this also makes the build selection hitbox smaller, so if you're getting annoyed by being unable to move the teleporter easily, try increasing the hitbox size in config.

</details>

### Large Lever Collision

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

Enlarges the start lever's hitbox so it can be pulled more easily at a moment's notice.

The exact size of the hitbox is also adjustable in one of the config sections.

</details>

### Begone Bottom Collision

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

Removes the colliders from bottom components of the ship (e.g. thrusters and structural supports), making it easier to access if that is desired. This is still moon dependent, and the underside of the ship still cannot be accessed on the Company moon, for example.

</details>

### Ship Item Removals

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (except maybe interactables like clipboard and sticky note?)*

Under "Ship Tweaks Removals" in config, you will find a list of items you can remove from the ship according to your aesthetic preferences:
- Service manual clipboard
- "SIGURD" sticky note
- Teleporter button cord
- Long tube (the one connected to the generator which is strewn across the floor)
- Generator (next to the door)
- Helmet (on the counter by the monitors and teleport buttons)
- Oxygen tanks (leaning against the wall)
- Boots (by the suit rack)
- Air filter (in the corner by the monitors)
- Monitor wires (in the corner behind the monitors)
- Batteries (on the counter by the monitors)

Although not *on* the ship exactly, it's similar enough to be grouped here:
- The clipboard manual which comes with the Company Cruiser

</details>

## SHIP ADDITIONS

### Fancy Button Panel

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Do you need something shiny and clicky to distract you from the tedium of your job? Good news! The company will now provide you with a realistic, interactable, and dynamically animating panel at the front of your ship! You may now press buttons and turn knobs to your heart's content.

The lights on this panel will also change and animate depending on the ship's state. Specifically: when taking off, routing, or landing, when the doors are closed, when a player is being teleported, when a signal is being transmitted, when the time goes past 10:00pm, and when being fired.

![ShipFancyPanel](https://imgur.com/VRblh4G.png)

If you really want functions for these buttons and knobs other than something to fidget with, some uses are provided by the following Rotating Floodlight addition (see it below for details). Though it's not quite a "function", you can also change what tooltips display for each button in the config.

I've made it very simple to patch the functions on each button and knob, so other mods can easily interface with it if they'd like to (a map of button names is provided on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Science-Bird/ScienceBirdTweaks), along with all the source code). I'm also open to adding more functions for these myself, so feel free to suggest something (my Discord thread is linked at the bottom of the page).

</details>

### Rotating Floodlight

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Something to make your ship experience more dynamic: the big top-mounted floodlight can rotate.

![FloodlightSpinDemonstration](https://imgur.com/qYCJYxP.gif)

This is toggled by a button next to the ship's lever, and works especially well with "blackout" effects (see associated section) or generally dark moons, making the ship easier to spot and providing dynamic lighting to the surroundings.

**Floodlight Configuration Controls**: In addition to changing properties such as speed, brightness, and angle in the config, some can be adjusted in-game via the ship's main panel:
>*Default: ON - All clients*

- **Reset Position Button**: Resets the floodlight to its default orientation.

- **Rotation Speed Knob**: Adjust the speed of rotation on the fly, up to twice your configured speed or as low as half the configured speed.

- **Player Targeting Toggle (EXPERIMENTAL)**: Switches to a mode where the floodlight will face towards the closest player outside the ship (within a certain distance). This is separately configurable from the other controls.
>*Default: OFF - All clients*

One additional configurable mode:

- **Rotate On Landing**: The floodlight will start rotating automatically once the ship lands.
    
    >*Default: OFF - All clients*

At some point this might be turned into a purchasable upgrade, but for now it's just something you can enable.

</details>

### Dynamic Occupancy Sign

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

With so many cooks in the kitchen, it seems like the company fire code may need some updating! This adds additional "maximum occupancy posters" (up to 16), which will dynamically update as players join the lobby (or can be manually set to some specific value in config).

These come in two styles, see if you prefer the amateur or professional flavour:

![OccupanyComparison](https://imgur.com/HXEyNNm.png)

</details>

### Player Death Effects

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

These are two additions that try different approaches to give more information about how many of your crewmates are left alive:

- **Broadcast Death Notification**: All living players will hear a quick series of beeps indicating somebody has died (you can imagine this like a distress call or network disconnection). It's up to you to listen carefully and keep track of how many have fallen.
>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **Auto Teleport Bodies**: If your ship has a teleporter, bodies will be teleported immediately after death and collected in the ship as scrap. This collection notification is a more clear way of notifying other players of their passing. In addition, players whose bodies cannot be recovered by teleporter will show a similar notification for an "unrecoverable body".
>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Like the rotating floodlight, these may someday be re-imagined as full ship upgrades.

</details>

## GENERAL TWEAKS

### *FIXES*

<details>
<summary><b>Show</b></summary>

---

### Missing Hover Tip Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Have you ever noticed that if you start holding down interact before you actually get to the trigger, the interact icon and text won't appear like they would if you started the interact after hovering over the trigger? Maybe I'm just crazy for this one, but either way here's a tweak.

</details>

### Hands Full Hover Tip Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Isn't it strange how it says "[Hands full]" on interactions that you can still perform while holding a two-handed item? It seems like that should only appear when you aren't able to do something with your hands full. Well, wonder no longer. This might be more of a UI oversight than a "fix", but hopefully you appreciate it nonetheless.

</details>

### Stretched Hand Icon Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Fixes a common issue on modded moons where the hand icons on doors or other interactable objects become stretched incorrectly.

</details>

### Smoke Particle Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

The exhaust smoke from the company cruiser, smoke trail left by old birds, and smoke from explosions are now affected by fog, and thus don't stick out strangely when seen from far away. This comes with the compromise of the particles not looking quite as nice as vanilla, but it's a subtle difference.

![SmokeFixDemo](https://imgur.com/vv7kB6H.png)

</details>

### Bridge Items Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

If a bridge falls and you've left an item up there, have no fear! Items on vanilla collapsing bridges will now fall down with them.

</details>

### Joining Clients Item Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

This fixes a vanilla issue where when players join, the fact that all the items are in the ship isn't updated. For example, if a client picks up an item after joining, it would act as if it had been collected in the ship for the first time.

I believe this is also fixed by other mods, but it's included here for better compatibility with some of the scrap keeping tweaks (see associated section).

</details>

### Mine Explosion On Exit Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

Fixes a vanilla issue where after stepping on a deactivated mine then leaving the interior, the mine would explode (other mods might've already gotten to this, but either way it's here for compatibility with the zap gun and hazard reworks).

*(If you're curious why, it's because mines don't actually check that you've stepped off them when they're deactivated, and mines are also set to explode when you're teleported off them. Since the exit doors count as teleports and the mine doesn't know that you've stepped off of it, it explodes)*

</details>

### Appliance Interaction Fixes

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

Fixes some of the colliders on the fridge and microwave furniture items so you can't grab them through walls, and the shelves in the fridge shouldn't prevent you from placing items or offset them strangely.

</details>

### Ship Monitor Fixes

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Fixes the monitor showing random elements (like ship icon and video feed) on the screen during the transition after taking off and in the results screen, as well as removing the black boxes surrounding the video feed.

</details>

### Lingering Lightning Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

Cuts off all lightning particles and sounds when a conductive object is taken into the interior (no more phantom lightning effects when you bring in an item as it's about to be struck by lightning). Also makes some changes to GeneralImprovements lightning HUD indicators to improve accuracy and not linger inside.

</details>

### Falling Rotation Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

Normally, if you drop an object from high up, it will rotate much slower than the rate it falls. This means the object will hit the ground while its rotation is still being updated (and the game will still consider it in a "falling" state).

The only immediate consequence of this bug is the visual effect of objects strangely spinning on the ground when you drop them from high up. This change may also end up making them set off mines on contact in more cases (rather than setting them off *only* after their rotation is finished).

In any case, this tweak scales this rotation so it will finish while the object is still in the air and its falling state will end normally.

*The default value of this tweak has been changed to OFF after some reports of issues (the fix is so small that it's really not worth risking). However, its code has remained unchanged for a long time and I've never encountered any issues nor recieved any other reports, making it likely a mod incompatibility. So, it should be safe to enable this in most cases, but if you do end up having issues please send the details to me.*

</details>

### Pause Menu Flicker Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

I call this a "fix", but it's more like a janky work-around. If you've had an issue with the "Resume" button flickering when you open the pause menu, this will resolve that by making the currently selected option always highlighted. This does look a little strange in-game, but it's better than flickering at least.

The flickering isn't a vanilla issue (at least to a meaningful extent), but I'm uncertain what mod(s) cause it or how widespread it is. Either way, this is a tweak that exists.

</details>

### Replace Null Items

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

If a moon or interior hasn't registered its items properly, those items will enter a bugged state when leaving the moon or reloading a save. This mainly entails the item becoming invisible and can lead to errors when other mods try to interface with the item.

This tweak will check for items with null properties on level transitions and attempt to find the intended item properties and swap the items out with new ones. This may not consistently solve the issue under all circumstances, but it's certainly better than nothing.

If you are certain you will never encounter bugged items like this, you are free to disable this (it may have a slight performance impact on level transitions).

</details>

### Disable Crouched Damage Animation

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

Disables the damage animation when a player is crouched. This animation would cause the player to briefly stand up when taking damage, which can be quite awkward and deadly in some situations.

</details>

---

</details>

### Clean Belt Bag UI

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Clears all the scan nodes on your screen when opening the belt bag's menu, to keep everything from looking cluttered (since scan nodes will appear over top of the belt bag interface).

</details>

### Big Screw

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Changes the name of the "big bolt" to reflect what it actually is (a big screw).

</details>

### Sapsucker Eggs Scream At Maneaters

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

I'll level with you on this one: this does not address anything that will come up in normal gameplay. However, it is fairly entertaining to watch the sapsucker eggs scream moments before meeting their demise at the hands of a baby maneater if you somehow end up in a situation where a maneater eats a sapsucker egg.

</details>

### Radar Pathfind To All Exits

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

**WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL**

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

The blue guiding line on the radar will now route you to whatever exit is closest, instead of always showing the way to the main entrance. Note that "closest" here means the direct distance to it, not considering walls and walkable pathways.

</details>

### Apparatus Hazard Shutdown

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Along with doors being opened, traps like turrets, mines, and spike traps will also be shut down when a power outage is triggered by removing the apparatus.

</details>

### Breaker Hazard Shutdown

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Along with doors being opened, traps like turrets, mines, and spike traps will also be shut down when a power outage is triggered by switching the breaker (everything reactivates when the breaker is turned back on).

</details>

### Mute Spike Trap Audio When Disabled

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

Disables the little warning screech sound effect when you're standing under a spike trap if that spike trap is disabled/on cooldown.

</details>

### Sun Always Casts Shadows

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

Have you noticed the ship being way too bright inside when you land on certain modded moons? This is often because the sun isn't casting any shadows! There will be some performance hits, but this will enable sun shadows on every moon.

</details>

### Place Furniture While Afraid

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

If you've found yourself brought to the brink of madness by unfathomable creatures and would only find comfort in organizing your ship's decor, rejoice! With this enabled, you will be able to move around furniture even when afflicted by the fear/insanity effect.

</details>

### Fade Out Sun Texture After Sunset

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

I'm still working out the kinks on this one, but the idea is: this will gradually darken the sun before hiding it completely as the sun sets, which is useful if you're on a moon with terrain that doesn't hide the sun texture very well at sunset.

</details>

### Old Halloween Elevator Music

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

Reverts the behaviour of the mineshaft elevator to its behaviour from the 2024 Halloween patch (v65 to v68), playing a random clip of groovy music by [ZedFox](https://zedfox.carrd.co/). The track is synced, so players using the same mod will hear the same elevator music track.

![ElevatorMusicLogo](https://imgur.com/8iIZjuE.png)

ButteryStancakes has a more [extensively customizable version of this feature](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/HalloweenElevator/), and if that mod is detected this tweak automatically disables to let it take priority.

</details>

### Scanned Item Highlights

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

**WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL**

>*Default: Disabled - All clients*

Creates holographic highlights around scanned scrap (also works with mods that give tools scan nodes). Can be adjusted to a more performant version if there are problems with lag.

</details>

### Apparatus Spawning Configuration

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

- **Apparatus Increased Enemy Spawn Chance**: When the apparatus is pulled, there is a 70% chance for the spawn rate per hour to be increased. This chance can now be adusted using this config option.

>*Default: 70% - All clients*

- **Apparatus Minimum Enemy Spawns**: The new minimum enemy spawns per hour to set (if it's bigger than current minimum) when the spawn chance above succeeds.

>*Default: 2 - All clients*

</details>

### Configurable Starting Moon

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: Experimentation - All clients*

At last, you can configure the starting moon (on new save or after being fired) to whatever you want! Just put in the name of the moon (no numbers needed), and whether it's paid, free, vanilla, or modded, that will be the new starting moon.

</details>

### Scrap Muting

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: Nothing - All clients*

Provided in the config is a list of scrap items that will have their passive noise effects disabled. This covers a variety of different noisemaking items from the animating ones that make noise when picked up, to special items like the clock and laughing masks, and even includes some weird modded edge cases like Magic Wesley's radioactive barrels. Muting an item this way means dogs won't hear them either.

</details>

### Single Item Day Blacklist

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: Nothing - All clients*

A list of scrap items in config which won't be used for a "single item day" where only one type of scrap spawns. Note that rare scraps and two-handed scrap are already blacklisted in vanilla.

</details>

## ENEMY TWEAKS

### Coilhead Elevator Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

Fixes an issue with elevators that would cause player sightlines to not be properly communicated to other clients, meaning coilheads could sometimes move when a player in an elevator was looking at them. This took a lot of trial and error to figure out, so please enjoy this fix.

</details>

### Maneater Attack Networking Fix

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

Fixes an issue with how the maneater handles multiple targets that would cause it to attack without winding up after switching targets (specifically due to one of its timers being stored locally on each client and not synced properly).

</details>

### Gimme That Mask

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

When a mask is killed you can now grab that mask right off their face! This is very similar to the mod [TakeThatMaskOff](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SillySquad/TakeThatMaskOff/), but unlike that mod, this should (hopefully) not cause any de-syncs or other bugs.

This should be compatible with most common masked changing mods like [Mirage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/qwbarch/Mirage/), the various mods fixing masked behaviour, and any mods adding tragedy masked enemies, but it does rely on there actually being a mask on the enemy. So, **if you have any configuration enabled which removes the masks from masked enemies, this tweak won't do anything**.

The average scrap value of these recoverable masks is also configurable (default is 25, set fairly low so mask farming doesn't become too powerful).

![GrabbableMaskDemonstration](https://imgur.com/PskfkCv.png)

This is also compatible with the "oni" masked from [s1ckboy's Seichi](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/s1ckboy/Seichi/)!

</details>

### Snare Flea Forgiveness Options

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: Vanilla - All clients*

Provides some alternatives to the vanilla behaviour of the snare flea/centipede:

- **Second chance:** provides players with a second chance, as the snare flea will leave them alone one time after bringing them to low health (default/vanilla is 15 HP).
    - This is equivalent to the singleplayer mechanic, just implemented in multiplayer (any config changes to this mechanic will also affect the singleplayer mechanic as well).

- **Fixed damage:** The snare flea will do a fixed portion (default 50%) of a player's maximum health before dropping off them (when set at 50%, players will always be killed on their second encounter if their health is above half, and killed on their first encounter if it's below half).
    - To account for Lethal Company's built-in "extra life" when a player reaches critical health (saving them from lethal damage once), a snare flea will always damage a player when they are at critical HP.

These come with config options like the low health threshold for second chance and the health % for fixed damage.

</details>

### Earth Leviathan Burrowing Tweaks

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

There are two included options for customizing earth leviathans:

- **More Surfaces**: Allows earth leviathans to burrow through more surfaces rather that just the default "natural" surfaces of grass, gravel, and snow (exact list of added surfaces is configurable).

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **Quicksand Holes**: Earth leviathans leave behind patches of quicksand where they emerge from and enter the ground (for surfaces which support quicksand), making them more impactful on the map environment.

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

</details>

### Maneater Difficulty Options

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

There are plenty of mods that make maneaters easier to deal with, but what about harder?

- **Transformation Interruption**: When hit while transforming, the maneater will immediately enter its chase mode.

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **Faster Doors**: Maneaters will open doors a bit quicker.

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

</details>

### Tulip Snake Quiet Laugh

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

If you think the tulip snake noises attracting dogs was a bridge too far, well, this is the tweak for you.

</details>

## ZAP GUN & MAP HAZARD OVERHAUL

### Hazard Cooldown Animations

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Unlike turrets, mines and spike traps don't have any obvious animations or audio cues for when they are disabled by the terminal. This tweak changes their lights to green, and for mines their flashing speeds up significantly accompanied by a new sound effect.

This will automatically be enabled if using the zap gun rework described in the following section, since this kind of feedback is more important if you're disabling traps right in front of you rather than from the ship.

*(See Zappable Hazards section for visual demonstrations of these animations)*

</details>

### Zap Gun Tutorial Improvements

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

I haven't thoroughly tested this or seen it documented elsewhere, but it seems like the zap gun "tutorial arrow" which guides your mouse movement isn't working as intended at all. In my experience, the tutorial tends to always appear for the host, but never other players.

<details>
<summary><i>Expand for wordy explanation</i></summary>

>*From looking at the code, it seems like the tutorial is supposed to only happen the first 2 times you use it. The issue is that the code that increments the number of uses requires the player to have used the gun for a certain amount of time before running, but this timer value seems to usually be set to zero before that check happens, thus the game never increments the tutorial counter. Another issue is that your progress in the tutorial is only saved if the tutorial is still active, meaning that even if you manage to increment the counter and finish the tutorial, the fact that it's finished means it won't save, and you'd have the tutorial again after restarting.*

</details>

<br />

I've tried my best to restore what I assume is the intended behaviour, as well as making it generally configurable so you can adjust to your liking with the following modes:

>*Default: Only First Time - All clients*

- **Only First Time**: The assumed intended behaviour: each player will individually experience the tutorial their first few times (number configurable), then never again after that.

- **Per Session**: Same as above, but instead of only happening once, it resets each session (in-case you need a reminder).

- **Always**: Simply always shows the tutorial for all players.

- **Vanilla**: Leaves it unpatched.

<br />

**Tutorial Animation Change**
>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

Another thing that bothered me about the vanilla implementation is that the arrow graphic itself is a little misleading. The mouse icon continually repeats left or rightwards swipes, but what you should really be doing is shifting then holding the mouse on one side or the other, not swiping.

So, I also threw together a dynamic behaviour for the mouse which will adjust its position relative to how far off target you are. It's still pretty janky looking, but the option is there for those interested.

</details>

### Zappable Hazards

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

>*(Zap gun changes as a whole are disabled by default, but the individual tweaks have their own default values when the zap gun rework is enabled)*

Turrets, mines, spike traps, and the big airlock/pressure doors in the facility interior all become zappable by the zap gun. This behaves the same way as disabling them with the terminal, but the time a given hazard stays deactivated is dependent on how long you manage to zap it for (individual base cooldowns and scaling factor are configurable).

The big doors are a bit different: zapping a closed big door will "jam" it open for as long as you're zapping it, but close as soon as you let go. It's not too hard to let players (or other things) through this way, but you'll find it's hard to get yourself through...

*(Currently, no modded hazards are supported)*

A few properties of the zap gun and hazards are also configurable:

- Battery life of the zap gun
    
- Priority list for which types of entities should be zapped when there are multiple valid targets

**If you have any mods which re-balance the zap gun, it's recommended you disable those or adjust their config (e.g. [ButteRyBalance](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/ButteRyBalance/)). Not just to avoid errors with conflicts, but because allowing traps to be zapped significantly buffs the zap gun, so additional buffs to their battery life or other things can easily make them a little unbalanced.**

### Deadly Facility Doors

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

>*(Only activates if zap gun rework is enabled)*

To balance the ability to jam doors open, the facility doors now kill players when closing. It's pretty tough to get through one while being slowed by the zap gun!

Also enabled by default is the ability for these doors to kill enemies. Both of these work when closing them from the terminal, too.

## BETTER DUST CLOUDS

### Dust (Space) Clouds

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Adds a space to the `DustClouds` weather condition when it's displayed on the main level screen or terminal monitor, making it `Dust Clouds`.

Dust clouds isn't used in vanilla, so you'll only see this if a modded moon or weather mod adds dust clouds into the rotation.

</details>

### New Visuals and Audio

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

A few tweaks to make dust clouds into a more interesting and gameplay-relevant weather:

- **Thick Dust Clouds**: Increases the thickness of the dust clouds (exact value configurable).
>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **Dust Clouds Noise**: Adds windy sound effects to the dust clouds (same as you hear on blizzard moons like Rend and Dine).
>*Default: OFF - All clients*

![DustCloudsComparison](https://imgur.com/xcQ6d4k.png)

(Before and after)

Since dust clouds is an unused weather in vanilla, you'll only see this weather if it's explicitly added on a modded moon, or you use a mod like [WeatherInjector](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ZetaArcade/WeatherInjector/) to add them into the normal weather rotation (which I recommend if you're interested in these changes).

</details>

## SELECTIVE SCRAP KEEPING

### Keep Worthless Scrap

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

Are you a hoarder? Do you like keeping silly items in your ship even when their only worth is sentimental? Here's some special configurable behaviours relating to scrap items with zero value (e.g. if you gamble them via [LethalCasino](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrgrm7/LethalCasino/)):

- **Keep Worthless Scrap**: Worthless scrap won't be removed from the ship along with the rest of the scrap when all players die.

>*Default: ON - All clients*

- **Worthless Scrap Scan Text**: When a piece of worthless scrap is taken into the ship, it will get some custom flavour text when scanned. By default, the value of the item will simply say "Priceless". Items can be blacklisted from this feature in config.

>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

*(Joining Clients Item Fix should be enabled for this to work properly upon loading a save)*

![PricelessScanText](https://imgur.com/K1VjLS1.png)

*You can find this plush and many others in my [dedicated scrap mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ScienceBird/Polished_Plushies_and_Silly_Scrap/) :)*

</details>

### Keep Custom Scrap List

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

Some additional configuration allowing you to customize how certain scrap is kept:

- **List of Scrap to Keep**: A configurable list of specific items to keep when all players die and scrap is lost. By default, this list only includes the shotgun.

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **Zero Kept Scrap Value**: When an item from this list is kept, its scrap value will be set to zero.

>*Default: ON - All clients*

</details>

These should be compatible with [Zigzag's SelfSortingStorage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zigzag/SelfSortingStorage/) (likely not any other storage mods at the moment).

*`Credit for these tweaks goes to xameryn`*

## SHOTGUN QUALITY OF LIFE

### Better Tooltips

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

Improves the readability of shotgun tooltips:

- **Show Loaded Shells**: The number of currently loaded shells are displayed.

>*Default: OFF - Client-side*

*This is essentially a port of [AmmoIndicator by ironbean](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ironbean/AmmoIndicator/) or the feature in [AtomicStudio's Better Shotgun Tooltip](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AtomicStudio/Better_Shotgun_Tooltip/) (and a similar feature is added in many other mods), all credit for the idea/implementation goes to them, it's just bundled here for compatibility.*

- **Custom Safety Tooltip**: The safety tooltip is made more clear, and is fully customizable in config.

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

*The default new tooltip is also from [AtomicStudio's Better Shotgun Tooltip](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AtomicStudio/Better_Shotgun_Tooltip/), but it doesn't appear to display correctly (in the modpacks I've tested), so it's also implemented here.*

- **Dynamic Tooltip Behaviour**: The reload tooltip will only appear when you are actually able to reload the shotgun (when paired with the unload shells option).

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

![ShotgunNewTooltips](https://imgur.com/n6GiLV3.png)

*(A lot of these behaviours are clustered together and not individually able to be disabled, but if you want to totally reject all these changes, there's a "master disable" option in the config)*

</details>

### Unloading & Checking Shells

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

When the shotgun is unable to be reloaded, you can use the reload button to open up the chambers of the shotgun (with the tooltip dynamically updating accordingly). This acts as a more natural way of checking how much ammo you have.

![OpenChamberAnim](https://imgur.com/pwHv8YM.png)

If you keep holding down the button for a short time with the chambers open, you will eject all your currently loaded shells onto the ground, allowing you to redistribute them as you please.

![EjectedShells](https://imgur.com/J44BjUC.png)

The opening chambers part of this sequence is ported from [LCAmmoCheck](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/axd1x8a/LCAmmoCheck/) by [Axd1x8a / Aъ / FeeeeK](https://github.com/feeeek/) with their permission. Thank you for allowing me to integrate this here!

The unloading and shotgun animating parts of this are separately configurable, so you can check ammunition without the eject functionality, or simply hold down to eject without any animation.

</details>

### Pick Up In Orbit

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

- **Pick Up Shotgun In Orbit**: Allows you to pick up the shotgun while in the ship orbit phase.
>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

- **Pick Up Shells In Orbit**: Allows you to pick up the shotgun shells while in the ship orbit phase (this is enabled by default to make the use of the unloading feature more smooth).
>*Default: ON - Client-side (?)*

I'm not familiar with the specifics, but I've heard that not being able to pick up certain items in orbit helps reduce weird issues with items or desyncs. This is why these are configurable for only these specific items and only shells are enabled by default. So, use at your own risk I guess.

</details>

### Keep Shotgun Upon Scrap Loss

(see Selective Scrap Keeping)

## BLACKOUT

### True Blackout - MrovWeathers

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

This is a total rewrite of the blackout weather from [MrovWeathers](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/MrovWeathers/), which shuts off all lights in the map, featuring:

- Darkened emissivity of associated light textures, meaning that lights will not look pure white or with a texture reflecting an "on" state. Instead, they will look dark/dim as if they have been turned off.
- More lights should be caught in the search (especially interior ones).
- Certain lights like those on traps or outdoor apparatuses will be excluded automatically.
- Light switches on maps like Rend, Adamance, and Artifice will have no effect
- Configurable blacklists of what kinds of lights/parent objects should be excluded from the blackout routine.
- Configurable ship floodlight properties during a blackout (brightness, angle, etc.).
- Configurable behaviour of the sun (either excluding it from blackout or making it the only thing affected by blackout)
- Highly optimized performance (especially compared to the previous experimental version of this tweak) which batches the lights to shut off in cycles rather than all at once.
- Fun new (configurable) sound effect!

In-fact, this feature has come such a long way that it's become hard to justify not merging it into Mrov Weathers itself, so that may happen in the future.

![BlackoutComparison](https://imgur.com/v2P98AD.png)

*(Note that despite how far it's come, this feature is still a work in progress and some textures in modded moons/interiors likely haven't been addressed by us yet)*

Technically this has some gameplay impacts by making the map overall a bit darker and thus harder to navigate, and a bit easier by preserving all hazard lights, but this is mainly meant to be an aesthetic change.

The same logic is used in the Apparatus True Blackout tweak in the following section, so if you're interested in this without wanting Mrov Weathers, you can enable that.

</details>

### Other True Blackout Options

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

- **Apparatus True Blackout**: When removing the apparatus, lights both inside and out will be shut off, along with any emissive textures (using the same logic as the above MrovWeathers True Blackout tweak). This of course does not include the sun.

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **True Blackout Hazard Shutdown**: During the MrovWeathers Blackout weather, power will be shut down and hazards shut off in the facility (making things generally much easier).

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **Blackout Sound Effect**: Plays a "powering down" sound effect upon a blackout occurring (Mrov Weathers' blackout or Apparatus True Blackout).

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

</details>

*`Credit for most of these tweaks goes to xameryn`*

## HEAD CAM TWEAKS

### Adjustable Cam Direction and Position

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: No changes - Client-side (?)*

These include two angles and two position offsets allowing you to move the camera around, pitch it up or down, and turn it around to face the player. You'll probably need to play with these values a bit if you intend on changing the camera significantly.

</details>

### Adjustable Cam Clipping/Render Distance

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: 0 - Client-side (?)*

This can be used to increase how far out the player cam renders (to see more of what's in front of them).

</details>

### See Your Own Cam

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

Replacing the generic placeholder graphic you normally see for your own cam, this will accurately render your own camera feed as if you were any other player!

If you rotate the camera to face towards you, your model will be a blocky low-poly version. This can be fixed by an extra experimental setting: 

**WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL (WILL LIKELY CAUSE ISSUES WITH MODS CHANGING THE PLAYER MODEL)**

- **See Your Own High Poly Model**: Renders your own player model at full quality. This is an involved change which caused me many headaches, so let me know if there's issues.

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

</details>

### Hide Cams

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

Some options for hiding player cams:

- **Hide Your Own Cam**: Instead of using a placeholder graphic, your own player cam won't be displayed for you at all (name textbox adjusted accordingly).

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

- **Hide All Cams**: All player cams will not be shown at all (name textbox adjusted accordingly).

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

</details>

### Cam Faces Player While Sprinting

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

Rotates the camera to face the player, but only while they're sprinting (for comedic effect).

</details>

### Improved Name Text Box

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

**WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL**

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

Allows player name displays on the radar screen to spread over multiple lines and shrink a bit more, so longer names can be displayed properly.

This should be compatible with the "Live Reaction" mod, which also alters radar name displays.

</details>

## BALANCING TOOLS

### Interior Scrap Analysis and Bonuses

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

**REQUIRES LETHAL LEVEL LOADER TO BE USED**

A set of two tools designed to be used together to help balance interiors:

- **Interior Scrap Density Logging**: Found under the technical configuration menu, this will log various bits of information about how scrap generated in an interior, including total number of scrap, average scrap per tile, and average scrap per unit area. It's not recommended to use this for regular play due to potentional performance losses on initial generation (especially for large interiors), but feel free to test and let me know how it runs.

- **Interior Scrap Bonuses**: This is its own config section, and allows you to add a fixed scrap bonus to a given interior whenever it generates (an alternative to attempting to change an interior's size). Modded interiors added via LLL are included here too. This config section generates automatically after starting a lobby.

![InteriorLogExample](https://imgur.com/dmIp8JC.png)

This is still an early prototype, so I'll see how useful this ends up being. In the future I might add an option to inject a dynamic amount of scrap depending how dense an interior typically is.

</details>

## MOD TWEAKS

*These tweaks **do not require the relevant mods** as dependencies, and if they are enabled without those mods, nothing will happen.*

### LLL Patches

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

Some quick patches I put in for [Lethal Level Loader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IAmBatby/LethalLevelLoader/):

- **LLL Unlock Syncing**: Manually applies the host's unlocked moons to all clients, so any moons the host has, the clients will have too (addressing an issue where unlocks in Wesley's Moons could become desynced). **This should be disabled when RandomMoonFX is installed**.
>*Default: OFF - All clients*

- **LLL Ship Lever Fix**: Fixes the ship lever being interactable while routing with LLL installed (note that this may cause issues with mods affecting the ship's routing, such as RandomMoonFX).
>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

</details>

### Video Tape Skip - Wesley's Moons

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - All clients*

If you like the tapes in [Wesley's Journey™](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Magic_Wesley/Wesleys_Moons/), but don't want to sit through the video every time, try this new and improved skippable cassette loader!

While playing, the projector will give you a prompt to skip the currently playing tape to the end and unlock the moon immediately.

![VideoTapeSkip](https://imgur.com/qjEYVwL.png)

Note this may have some unintended side-effects when used with tapes with special effects like the cursed tape.

</details>

### Weather Announcement Adjustment - WeatherTweaks

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - Client-side*

Adjusts the wording of the notifications to be a bit more clear for transitioning weathers in mrov's [WeatherTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/WeatherTweaks/), and explicitly state the current and upcoming weather (does not work with uncertain weather).

![WeatherTweaksNewAnnouncments](https://imgur.com/hFYA116.png)

</details>

### Terminal Stock - SelfSortingStorage/TerminalFomatter

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: ON - All clients*

A little patch for the niche interaction between Zigzag's [SelfSortingStorage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zigzag/SelfSortingStorage/)'s Smart Cupboard and mrov's [TerminalFormatter](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/TerminalFormatter/): items in the cupboard will now count towards the "owned" column in the terminal's store menu.

![TerminalStockDemo](https://imgur.com/26AId6p.png)

Try scrolling around or re-entering the store menu if you have any issues with the item counts not being immediately updated.

</details>

### Window Shutter Fix & Audio Adjustment - ShipWindows

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

- **Shutter Closing Fix**: Adds a function to [ShipWindows](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TestAccount666/ShipWindows/) where the shutters will now also close when taking off (if "Hide Moon Transitions" is enabled in ShipWindows config), in addition to closing when landing or routing.

>*Default: ON - All clients*

- **Shutter Switch Sound Effect**: There are two shutter sounds, one for the shutters opening and another for the shutters closing. This allows you to use one of the two sound effects for both opening and closing, or disable the sound effects playing altogether. Note that this refers to the noises made by the shutters/shutter switch themselves, and not the voice lines which play (those are configurable in ShipWindows config).

>*Default: Unchanged - Client-side (?)*

</details>

### No Signal Solar Flare - LethalElements/TwoRadarMap

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

>*Default: OFF - Client-side (?)*

When using [TwoRadarMaps](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zaggy1024/TwoRadarMaps/) and [LethalElements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/pacoito/LethalElementsTheta/), the radar map on the terminal will show the "no signal" screen during solar flares (since it's otherwise unaffected by the solar flare glitching effect).

</details>
