Lunar Config is an all-in-one configuration mod for Lethal Company. Lunar Config currently allows you to change various properties around items, enemies, moons, unlockables, and map objects (traps). It should register almost anything from any mod and vanilla, it does require DawnLib and BepInEx in order to function!).

# Notice!

The configuration files used by Lunar Config **NEED** to be shared between all clients playing in a lobby, differences are very prone to causing desyncs!

Also know that Lunar Config can be overwritten by other mods configuration, so if you are experiencing issues with your configurations not working correctly, please check any mods that may be potentially overwriting Lunar Config.

Changing some settings may also cause issues by nature, like the stunability of enemies, so keep this in mind when meddling with certain settings.

# Usage

After installing the mod, if you launch the game and load into a lobby, several configuration files should be generated. If you change anything in the 'LunarConfigCentral' file you will need to repeat this process for the configuration to refresh.

Any setting you want to change requires you to enable the "Configure Content" value in the given entry, otherwise the changes will not be acknowledged. I'm not going to go through each setting here as they are for the most part self-explanatory, but you can always ask questions in [the mod's discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1390479837025538048/1390479837025538048).

## Porting Pre-v0.2.0

**Before updating LunarConfig to v0.2.0, take a copy of your configuration files for safekeeping!**

As the formatting for configuration files changed with v0.2.0, Lunar includes a system to port files from older versions. 

Before loading your game on v0.2.0+ of Lunar, **turn off "Clear Orphaned Entries" in LunarConfigCentral.cfg!** Then, install a v0.2.0+ version of LunarConfig and load into a lobby. In LunarConfigCentral, there should now be an option to "Enable Backwards Compat", turn it on. Once this is done, you should be able to load into a lobby again and most your settings will transfer over (exceptions detailed below). **Be sure to turn it off after running the game once, or your old files will continue to overwrite any changes!**

Some settings that will NOT transfer over include:

* Anything in LunarConfigDungeons.cfg
* Anything in LunarConfigMapObjects.cfg
* Tags on moons

## Disabling Settings

Lunar Config includes **several** configuration settings, and it's unlikely you'll use all of them; in order to disable changing a setting to save on performance or prevent changing something you don't want to touch, you have three options:

**Entire File**\
You can either disable an entire configuration file if you don't want to change anything about any of a certain type of object, for instance you can disable modifying all enemies. With this option, the configuration file may still appear but it will not be refreshed and none of it's settings will be applied.

**Specific Object**\
If you don't want to change anything about a specific object, you can leave the "Configure Content" value of the entry disabled. This setting comes automatically disabled on all entries, requiring you to enable it if you want to change something.

**Setting Type**\
In the 'LunarConfigCentral' file, you should find entries relating to all the configuration files you have enabled, there you can disable a certain type of setting and it will not be shown in any of that file's configuration entries or touched by the mod.

## Help and Issues

If you need any help you are free to ask in this mod's thread in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1390479837025538048/1390479837025538048). You can also report issues there, or in the mod's [GitHub Page](https://github.com/CraftyC7/LunarConfig). If you have any questions, need any help, encounter any issues, or even have any suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out using one of those!

## Upcoming?

Hopefully as I have time I intend to add some of the following:

* Cleaner and more optimized code (please don't look at my mess now).
* Injection and modification of any setting based on the current moon, tags, current interior, or current weather.

## Credits

* The Lethal Company Modding Discord, essentially enabling me to make this mod, as I likely couldn't have figured it out without some of the people there.
* DawnLib, for being mostly easier to use than accessing 4 different libraries. (and Xu Xiaolan especially for tolerating me for months)
* Bongo Xiaolan for writing the custom catalogue ordering code.
