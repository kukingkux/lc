# v1.17.15

# v1.17.14
- Fixed a couple cause-of-death patches from v1.17.13 which did not work
# v1.17.13
- When using `ScanImprovements`, items which have been destroyed (gift boxes, homemade flashbangs, easter eggs, etc.) will no longer display on the scan command

  - The ship now inflicts "Crushing" (when stuck under the deck, previously "Gravity")
  - The item dropship now inflicts "Crushing" (previously "Gravity")
- Removed the patch for scanning in the Cruiser seats
  - If you are using the vanilla Cruiser and want this feature, install [CruiserImproved](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DiggC/CruiserImproved/) (you can disable all the other settings, this mod also includes a lot of useful Cruiser bugfixes)
  - By design, [Scandal](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/) intends for this to be impossible with [Version-55 Company Cruiser](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/Version55_Company_Cruiser/) (which I was breaking before)
  - This also allows custom vehicles like the [Company Hauler](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Glojam/Company_Hauler/) and [Scanvan](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/Vandal_Electronics_Scanvan/) to define their own behavior for scanning

# v1.17.10
- Fixed magnet attracting destroyed Cruisers
- Cruiser animation fixes (thanks [Scandal](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/))
  - Fixed steering animation being reversed (causing your hands to desync from the movement of the wheel)
  - Now the car key is positioned/rotated correctly when other players are starting the car
  - Fixed animations being "offset" from correct positions if you enter the car seat after performing other certain actions
  - Fixed cabin lights activating on delay if other players insert the car key
- Unpatched baboon hawks' navigation behavior when [CruiserImproved](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DiggC/CruiserImproved/) is installed
  - The Cruiser's functionality was updated in v70 making this patch irrelevant to Cruiser interactions
  - As a side effect, this patch also allowed Baboons into certain spaces that are too small for them to enter in vanilla...
- Cadavers
  - Added a setting to display "Filter quality" and fever/brainwave warnings (while blooming) in multiplayer
    - Fever warnings from high infection percentages still **do not** display
  - Optimized several functions which search for the Cadaver Growths' AI
    - Use [Weed Killer Fixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/WeedKillerFixes/) to apply these optimizations to weed killer as well

- Fixed (harmless?) error logs from ramming the Cruiser into certain enemies (mainly forest keepers)
# v1.17.7
- Fixed speaker audio desyncing between clients at Gordion
- Items dropped in the back of the Cruiser are no longer collected when running [Version-55 Company Cruiser](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/Version55_Company_Cruiser/)
- Optimized a few v80+ functions with VehicleController/MineshaftElevatorController caching (thanks [Scandal](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/))
# v1.17.6
- Fixed some specific circumstances which could allow Cadaver Blooms to reappear (visually) after death
# v1.17.5
- The full changelist is now available on the [Wiki](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/ButteryFixes/wiki/) tab. Thanks to [cookiecaker](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/cookiecaker/) for helping me get that set up
- Fixed walkie-talkies no longer transmitting audio if you have multiple in your inventory, and either drop or disable one
- Rewrote how scrap items are tracked, so the bottom line for a seed shouldn't decrease when players' inventories get destroyed on death

  - Fixed Cadaver Blooms displaying their radar visuals on bodycams after death

  - Storing furniture mid-quota will decrease this luck value
  - Reloading a save will restore your intended luck value
- Fixed some issues with invisible trees on March
- Backwater Gunkfish now dies at 0 HP like other enemies, instead of -1 HP (reduces shovel hits from 5 to 4)
# v1.17.2

  - Enabled by default again (I forgot enemies can collect items by dropping them in the ship, so teleporter makes sense too)
  - Fixed collect notification showing when teleporting somebody who was killed by the monster at Gordion

  - Hygrodere spreading (by [Zaggy1024](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zaggy1024/))
  - Spike traps spawning in mineshaft elevator
  - Gift box spawn chances
  - Hoarding bugs/baboon hawks bugging on rehost

    - Discounts now display correctly for all clients
	- Suit ads no longer fail to display
  - Magnifying glass being inspectable
  - Missing quote from collecting journal entries
- `GameResolution` has now become `ForceMaxQuality`, since the "Low" option previously available is now in v80 as "Performance" resolution
  - In the future I plan to just add this as a new resolution to the pause menu instead
- `ScanImprovements` is now on by default, as Zeekerss made the "scan" command work in orbit in v80
- `PatchPocketLights` is no longer configurable, as Zeekerss patched the exploit I made this setting for anyway
- Removed `AutoCollect` as Zeekerss changed how scrap collection works in v80
  - I might re-introduce this in the future as an "Extra" setting
- `BodiesCollectSelf` is now disabled by default because of item collection changes
- Removed `EndOrbitEarly` as all clients (host included) now exit "ship phase" together when the ship doors open in v80
  - In the future I'll probably have to work out a different fix for sapsucker eggs, if those are still broken
- Removed `KeysAreScrap` as keys now sell for $3 (special case) in v81
- Removed `AlterBestiary` (nutcracker guide text was restored in v80)
- "Critical injury" pop-up occurs at 20 HP again, like in vanilla
  - This means the pop-up no longer indicates the actual critically injured state (10 HP)
  - I had to revert this because Zeekerss added new effects for when you're below 18 HP
- Ported some fixes from [YesFox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Dev1A3/YesFox/)
  - Fox now adapts better to lobbies of increased size (such as with [More Company](thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/notnotnotswipez/MoreCompany/))

  - Removed `LimitSpawnChance`
  - Removed `UnlimitedOldBirds`

- Fixed static electricity particle (stormy weather) rendering incorrectly from specific camera angles
- Fixed missing quotes in "Found journal entry:" notification for the server host
- Automatic body collection
  - Now tied to `BodiesCollectSelf` config setting, rather than automatically disabling when [GeneralImprovements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ShaosilGaming/GeneralImprovements/) is installed. You should still probably only use one or the other
  - Retooled fix for body collection when players die on the ship (the old one from v1.9.0 didn't ever seem to work)
- Fixed missing collision for a sign on Adamance.
# v1.16.2
- `FilterDecor` now also corrects the formatting of the decor list (added missing bullets point and "Price:" text)
- Cruiser scan patch (from v1.10.18) no longer applies when [CruiserImproved](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DiggC/CruiserImproved/) is installed
  - This prevents the "Scan While Seated" setting from being ignored (and effectively treated as though it were always enabled)
  - Make sure to enable that setting (in CI's config) if you are suddenly missing that feature as a result!
# v1.16.1
- Hotfix for [V70PoweredLights Fix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/WaterGun/V70PoweredLights_Fix/) crash
# v1.16.0
- Disabled `AlterBestiary` by default (it was finally confirmed by Zeekerss that some "errors" were intentional all along)
- Updated `MaskHornetsPower` to (hopefully) play nicer when using external mods to customize power levels
  - Note: This will only work if *both* butlers and mask hornets have power level *greater than* 0
- You can now disable explosion-burnt bodies (from `PlayermodelPatches`) separately with the `CharredBodies` setting
- Cruiser magnet fixes
  - Magnet no longer pulls players in while it's being turned off
  - Magnet now affects all players in range, not just the one who pulls the switch
- Added `PatchPocketLights` setting
  - This lets you disable the helmet light fix from v1.5.2 (for having multiple types of flashlight turned on in your inventory at the same time)
  - As a side effect, this setting being enabled also patches a well-known infinite flashlight glitch.
  - On by default, which matches behavior from previous versions of Buttery Fixes.
- v73 Dine scrap fixes
  - Fixed certain type of flies appearing massive from faraway distances
  - Adjusted LoD distances for "Knee" item to reduce prevalence of an ugly shading issue on the bone
  - Fixed sporadic animation for "Heart" item when fear level is increasing/decreasing

  - Fixed line "contorting" strangely when targeted player is moving around the map
  - Line now displays when targeting a "masked"
- Fixed a tutorial pop-up about storing furniture, which previously didn't work for the host
- Cached a couple of references to the Cruiser in the sapsucker AI (thanks [Scandal](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scandal/))
# v1.15.3
- Fixed gift boxes having increased spawn chances ever since v70
  - [Zeekerss confirmed in Patreon chat](https://discord.com/channels/750645598293590077/974101195545280542/1424081957288935555) that this was a mistake (somehow the code from v69 Jolly was accidentally added back)
  - v1.14+ assigned this bonus weight to Zed Dog (which was also given boosted spawn chances in v70) instead, but I've removed that now (as Zed Dog boosts were reverted in v73)
- Fixed new v73 scrap having visible effects while pocketed
# v1.15.2
- Added an experimental `EndOrbitEarly` setting
  - Enabling it will cause clients to end orbit phase as soon as the lever is pulled (like the host) instead of after the doors open
  - This should fix some desync (most notably with Sapsucker eggs insta-hatching)
  - Might cause unexpected behavior with other mods if they expect vanilla's incorrect behavior, but I'm not currently aware of any examples
- Keys will now still use their special icon on the radar when using `KeysAreScrap`
  - You still need to use [BagConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mattymatty/BagConfig/) to store keys in a belt bag with this setting on. I don't plan to change this, sorry
# v1.15.1
- Compatibility with [Drop Ship Delivery Cap Modifier](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DrinkableWater/DropShipDeliveryCapModifier/)
# v1.15.0
- Finally added an `AdjustCooldowns` setting
  - Sorry for the stubbornness on this one
- Entering the ship should now auto-collect all items in your inventory, not just what you're holding in your hand
  - This change is (somewhat) experimental
  - If you notice any issues arising with items or scrap collection, turn off `AutoCollect` and see if it helps
- Tried to fix some desync between "most profitable" statistic when collecting scrap with the Cruiser
- Fixed "Items missed!" dropship message only displaying for host
- Fixed "Store item" text for microwave door
