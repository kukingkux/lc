## 2.2.12

- Fixed issue with enemies getting stuck and going brain dead after seeing the horrors of timeout corner. hi @NinjaFlout and @fullytilted
- Improved circuit bee's ability to see their own hives on the ship (but by how much, not sure since I don't collect hives much :sob: but tests showed they seem to successfully find their hive more often in the same scenario, for me).  hi @NinjaFlout
- Improved catwalk standable ledge outside the railing, by the back corner of the ship. hi @NinjaFlout WHAT, 4

## 2.2.10

- Updated reverb triggers when using extended balcony to try fix lag when standing in certain locations.

## 2.2.8
- Added inside ship positions for masked and LethalBots (tHaNkS T-Rizzle).
- Fixed framerate drop issue appearing past few updates (here you go @J͓̽0͓̽n͓̽4͓̽r͓̽e͓̽z͓̽ and other people, it was a reverb trigger thing, but still tell me if you somehow get it still).
- Fixed ladder climbing for wider 2-story ship's second ladder, once the ship has fully landed or is still in orbit (here you go @Dedicate. and @CẶC SIÊU TO, but tell me if you still get it when fully landed or in orbit).

## 2.2.7
- Added direct LethalBots orbit navmesh support (tHaNkS T-Rizzle). They uh, still will prefer the vanilla ship area when randomly wandering, and some spots might be funky. But I have to go for now :sob: fine tuning later I guess.

## 2.2.2
- Reverted default from 10 floors to 0. You're lucky I didn't want to overdo it for some lower-end systems. Infinite story ship will remain a genuine config option, and maybe even get some fine tuning updates.

## 2.2.1
- It is now mandatory. INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP
- Can re-adjust in config to opt out. INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP INFINITE STORY SHIP

## 2.1.6
- Fixed Melanie moment of not removing the excess front of ship extra model part when ShipWindows is enabled.

## 2.1.5
- Fixed misplaced window for ShipWindows compatibility on base 2-story ship. tHaNkS Arsin for reporting. I thought it was the other way around; you report arson.

- Offmeshlinks connecting to moon ground now use raycasts tracked on every land to allow enemy navigation on moons to be more compatible with larger ship size.
- Added offmeshlink (also using raycast) to front of ship to allow extra compatibility on moons.
- Updated navmesh blacklist (still defaulted false for now).

## 2.0.3
- Fixed non-wider 2 story having random extended walls outside, and awkward sharp corner in stairs.
- Added secondary rail base to cover ship ribs on wider 2-story default ship layout.
- Thickened front wall to hide open doors.
- Moved walls previously offset by 0.1 from original position, hiding lightswitch, etc.

- Moved default charger position for wider 2-story.

## 2.0.0
- Added "ship layout" config, exclusive to Wider + 2-Story ship, which allows you to switch between premade ship interior "room/wall" layouts for first and second floor (only 2 right now). Default layout changed, legacy (old) layout still available in config.
- Fully remade models of ships (should fix a handful of minor visual issues, like holes in ship stealing all our oxygen, and messed up textures).
- Ship surface audio is now automatically decided by object's "main" material.
- Ship hull and inside surface audios are now separate (you're WELCOME s1ckboy, smh, hates wood sound on metal roof).
- (Hopefully) Fixed ship door randomly turning players into mimes for a period of time, on Oxyde (some tests, but bug was random, so I could just be lucky).
- Fixed default ship style's floor lines not properly aligning cut-off section when using Ship Windows' floor window.
- Moved default door button panel position overwrite.

## 1.2.9
- Fixed updating offmeshlinks for old ship ladders (according to one test), which allowed some enemies to cheat into the ship. Doesn't affect moons not following vanilla scene ship navmesh hierchy.

## 1.2.8
- (Re)Added config to disable navmesh regen IN ALL CASES except if listed moon is on navmesh regen whitelist. Defaulted to false due to horrendous wait times, and sometimes even disallowing players (pacoito) to play on some packs.

## 1.2.7
- Adjusted ship navmesh to close off open corners in ship.
- Added 62 Lithium to navmesh regen blacklist.

## 1.2.6

## 1.2.2
- Moved catwalk-to-ship navlink to prevent enemies bypassing closed doors.

## 1.2.1
- Separated and properly labelled new ship navmesh surfaces. This should hopefully fix old birds landing inside the ship, and giants entering through open doors.
- Added navlink to invisble "nerf" navsection on wider 2-story ship, when enabled.

## 1.2.0
- Complete rework of navmesh (thank you XuXiaolan and fumo). Most moons no longer regenerate navmesh (faster loading). Some moons previously navmesh incompatible should now work with custom navmesh. And now ship can carry enemies when leaving! 😀

- Fixed ship map icon for v70 update.
- Removed deprecated navmesh blacklist config.

- Potentially fixed (based on like 1 test) Lethal Posters breaking the game when used with these mods. Posters still don't appear, but it saves people the trouble.
- Split main ship prefab parts into (more) sections to allow more versatility in changing sections (great for custom external mod compatibility).
Main section names are: Floor0, Roof0, Wall0, Wall1, Wall2, Wall3, Detail, and Catwalk. Parented under MelanieShip.

## 0.1.1
